<h1><p>COMMON LAYER INTERFACE (CLI)</p></h1>

<h3><p>VERSION  2.0
</p></h3>

<hr>

<h2>Introduction
</h2>

<p>The Common Layer Interface (CLI) is a universal format for the input of geometry data to 
model fabrication systems based on layer manufacturing technologies (LMT).  It is suitable for 
systems using layer-wise photo-curing of resin, sintering or binding of powder, cutting of sheet 
material, solidification of molten material, and any other systems which build models on a 
layer-by-layer basis.

<p>CLI is intended as a simple, efficient and unambiguous format for data input to all LMT-based 
systems, based on a "2 1/2D" layer representation.  It is independent of vendors or fabrication 
machines, and should require only a simple conversion to the vendor-specific internal data 
structure of the machine.  The obligatory parts of the format are also application independent, 
while the USERDATA command allows user- or application-specific data to be defined in the 
header.  This flexibility allows the format to be used for a wide range of applications, without 
loss of important information and without excluding data transfer between different 
applications.  One specific application, medical scan data, is already accommodated with 
appropriate user data.  Others can be added as they are defined.

<p>Comments and suggestions for future versions are welcome, and should be forwarded to one 
of the contacts named in Appendix A.


<h2><p>1.	Definitions and general conventions
</p></h2>

<h3>1.1.	2 1/2D-Representation
</h3>
<p>The geometrical information of the intersection of a 3D-model with a plane is called a 
slice. The volume between two parallel slices is called a layer. The 2 1/2D-representation 
of a model is the sum total of layer-descriptions. The slicing plane is parallel to the xy-
plane of a right hand cartesian coordinate system. It is assumed that the building 
direction is the positive z-axis. </p>

<h3>1.2.	Layer
</h3>
<p>A layer is the volume between two parallel slices, and is defined by its thickness, a set 
of contours and (optionally) hatches.
</p>

<h3>1.3.	Contour
</h3>
<p>Contours represent the boundaries of solid material within a layer, and are defined by 
polylines (section 1.4). They are classified as internal and external contours (Fig.1). For 
correct interpretation each contour must be closed and must not intersect itself or 
another contour.
</p>

<p><pre>               (Fig 1)</pre>
</p>

<h3>1.4.	Polyline
</h3>
<p>A polyline is defined by a set of vertex points (x,y), connected contiguously in the listed 
order by straight line segments. A closed polyline can also be called a polygon.
</p>

<h3>1.5.	Hatches
</h3>
<p>A hatch is a set of independent straight lines, each defined by one start and one end 
point (x,y).  The purpose of hatches and open polylines is to define support structures 
or filling structures to obtain a solid model, which are necessary for some LMT 
systems.


<h2><p>2.	ASCII Data Format</p></h2>

<h3>2.1.	File Structure
</h3>
<p>The ASCII-file is separated into sections. Each section is marked by a start and an end 
marker.
Only the characters A...Z, a...z, , ., 0...9, $ and the separators (section 2.4) are 
interpreted. All other characters will be ignored.
Each file must have a HEADER-section and a GEOMETRY-section. Other sections 
are optional. The start of the HEADER-section will be interpreted as the start of data, 
and the end of the GEOMETRY-section as the end of data.
Data may be included before the HEADER-section and after the GEOMETRY-section, 
but will be ignored.
</p>

<h3>2.2.	General Syntax
</h3>
<p>All commands have the general form:
<dl>
	<dd><p>Keyword/parameter
</dl>
<p>Keyword and parameter are separated by the character "/" (oblique stroke). If there are 
no parameters there should be no oblique stroke. The only exception to this rule is the 
command "//" (see description below).
</p>

<h4>2.2.1.	Keywords
</h4>
<p>Keywords are names according to the language description defined below. All 
keywords are written in ASCII upper case notation. Every keyword must start with the 
sequence "$$".
</p>

<h4>2.2.2.	Parameters
</h4>
<p>Parameters are numbers or ASCII-strings separated by the character "," (comma).
</p>

<h3>2.3.	Numbers</h4> 

<dl><dt><p>INTEGER:</p>
<dd>+/- k1...kn	:	every ki is a number from 0 to 9.
</dl>
<p>Negative numbers must have a minus sign, positive numbers can have a plus sign. 
Numbers with no sign are interpreted as positive. Maximum range is +/- 2^31.
</p>

<dl><dt><p>REAL:</p>
<dd>+/- x1...xn.y1...ym
<dd>n >= 0, m >= 0
<dd>1 <= (n + m) <= realim</dl>
<p>xi,yi are numbers from 0 to 9, respectively before and after the decimal point.
Realim is the maximum number of digits within a REAL and is limited to 16.
A decimal point is required for all REAL numbers.
</p>

<h3>2.4.	Separators
</h3>
<p>Separators are "/" (oblique stroke), "," (comma) and "//" (double stroke).
</p>

<h3>2.5.	ASCII-strings
</h3>
<p>An ASCII-string is any number of valid characters enclosed within double-quotes. 
Valid characters are all printable characters except the double-quotes.</p>

<h3>3.2.	Geometric Commands
</h3>

<p>Command :   start layer
<br>
Syntax :   $$LAYER/z
<br>
Parameter z : REAL
<br>
Start of a layer with upper surface at height z (z*units [mm]). All layers must be sorted 
in ascending order with respect to z. The thickness of the layer is given by the 
difference between the z values of the current and previous layers.  A thickness for the 
first (lowest) layer can be specified by including a "zero-layer" with a given z value but 
with no polyline.
<br>
___________

<p>Command :   start polyline
<br>
Syntax :  $$POLYLINE/id,dir,n,p1x,p1y,...pnx,pny
<br>
Parameters:
<br><pre>
	id		: INTEGER
	dir,n		: INTEGER
	p1x..pny	: REAL
</pre><br>
id : identifier to allow more than one model information in one file.
<br>
id refers to the parameter id of command $$LABEL (HEADER-section).<br>
dir : Orientation of the line when viewing in the negative z-direction
<br>
0 : clockwise (internal)
<br>
1 : counter-clockwise (external)<br>
2 : open line (no solid)
<br>
n : number of points
<br>
p1x..pny : coordinates of the points 1..n

<p>Polylines representing internal contours must be clockwise, polylines representing 
external contours counter-clockwise (Fig 2). This orientation must be valid for the 
parameter "dir" and for the order the points are listed. The value of "dir " overwrites 
the order of listed points if there is a mismatch.
<p>In the case of closed polylines (dir = 0,1)  p1x = pnx and p1y = pny must be valid.
The open line value for the dir flag can be used to indicate a non-closed polyline. This 
can be used as an input for correction and editing tools based on the CLI format. </p>

<h2>Appendix A  -  Development of the Common Layer Interface (CLI)
</h2>

<p>Development of the Common Layer Interface (CLI) originated in the Brite-EuRam Project 
"Rapid Prototyping Techniques", whose work programme identified the following need:

<p>"Problems with the current STL interface (triangle model) force us to look for a 
new data format for general LMT-processes, which may only contain cross 
section information...  The section oriented information should be vendor 
independent."

<p>Simultaneously, the Brite-EuRam Project "Phidias" was working to establish and make 
available an interface between medical scan data and layer manufacturing technologies. 
Cooperation between these two projects, together with comments and contributions from third 
parties, led to the development of CLI version 2.0.

<p>Further development and dissemination of the CLI is also continuing in cooperation with 
EARP (the European Action on Rapid Prototyping), an organization of companies and 
institutions throughout Europe which are actively working with rapid prototyping.  The up-to-
date version of CLI is (from September 1994) continuously available to Internet users under 
the World Wide Web, at the address given on the next page.  This also provides a forum for 
Internet users to discuss their use of CLI and make suggestions.

<h2>Appendix B  -  Header section for medical applications
</h2>


<h3><p>Introduction
</h3>
<p>This appendix describes a proposal for a $$USERDATA header section (see 3.1.3) to be used 
for medical applications.
<p>The extension of the CLI-Header proposed here describes the absolute minimum of labeling 
considered necessary for medical applications. The definitions are part of work performed 
within the Brite-Euram project Phidias towards the development of a format for the exchange 
of segmentation results.
<p>The additions are primarily inserted in order to achieve unambiguous documentation and 
labeling of the history of the data generation process and of the patient orientation in medical 
applications. For the actual model building process they can be ignored. The CLI-file 
generation programm must ensure that if x- and y-coordinates and the positive z-direction are 
interpreted as righthand system, an anatomically correct model will result!
With respect to the coordinate interpretation the following assumptions common in slice 
oriented imaging modalities are made:
<p>The "volume"/"model"/"stack of layers" coordinate system is defined as a righthand system 
with the following properties
<br><pre>
*	x- and y-axis lie within the image/layer plane with
			(x) pointing from left to right
			(y) pointing from top  to bottom
*	The z-axis is orthogonal to the slice/image/layer plane with
			(z) pointing into the image plane
*	The patient orientation is described by another righthand system defined by three base 
vectors:
 	medial-rightlateral	(nose->right ear)	as x-axis
 	posterior-anterior	(spine->chest)		as y-axis: "FRONT-VECTOR"
 	caudo-cranial		(foot->head)		as z-axis: "HEAD-VECTOR"
</pre>
<p>The "cartesian coordinates" of HEAD-VECTOR and FRONT-VECTOR in the layer 
coordinate system fully specify the patient orientation!
Gantry tilt must be taken into account when converting image matrix coordinates into the layer 
coordinate system! For the sake of simplicity gantry tilt will be ignored, however, when 
describing patient orientation (the same effect is caused by putting the patient on a slanted 
couch).
<p>
<pre>
The following three examples use the definitions
	axial:		orthogonal to HEAD-VECTOR
	coronal:	orthogonal to FRONT-VECTOR
	sagittal:	contains HEAD-VECTOR and FRONT-VECTOR


Example 1:	Patient in prone position, axial images reconstructed looking
		in the cranial direction
			HEAD-VECTOR  = ( 0,  0,  1)
			FRONT-VECTOR = ( 0, 1,  0)

Example 2:	Coronal reconstructions looking onto the chest of the patient
			HEAD-VECTOR  = ( 0, -1,  0)
			FRONT-VECTOR = ( 0,  0, -1)

Example 3:	Sagittal reconstructions looking from the right to the left
		side of the patient
			HEAD-VECTOR  = ( 0, -1,  0)
			FRONT-VECTOR = ( 1,  0,  0)

Syntax

The $$USERDATA section of the CLI-Header (3.1.3) contains information in ASCII-format of 
the following form (see also page 11)
		userdata:		{userdata-item}...{userdata-item}
		userdata-item:		keyword=text "/0"	("/0" = binary zero)

The following keywords are possible 
	institution-id		Institution where primary data were generated
	source-id		Additional information specifying the creation of
				this file, eg. software package and person generating
				the data set
	patient-id		Qualifier uniquely specifying the patient
	study-id		Qualifier specifying the type of study performed
	examination-date	Date on which examination was performed
	slice-thickness	Slice thickness in mm
	matrix-size		Size of the image matrix (typically 512)
	pixel-size		Size of one pixel in mm
	gantry-tilt		Gantry tilt of the examination in degrees
	front-vector		vector pointing from "spine to chest " expressed in layer
				coordinates in the form (x,y,z) (see introduction)
	head-vector		vector pointing from "feet to head" expressed in layer
				coordinates in the form (x,y,z) (see introduction)
